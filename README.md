# Jsosso Json Parser

Jsosso is a simple Json parser.
It provides a Json datatype and

- a serializer to transform Json data into byte vectors,
- a parser to read Json values from streams,
- a random Json value generator.

The main purpose of Jsosso is to serve as a demonstrator for [pacosso].
As such, it highlights simplicity, not performance
or other features you may expect from a full-fledged Json parser.
