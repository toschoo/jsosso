		"A number n is prime if it is greater than 1 and has no positive divisors except 1 and n.",
		"A natural number is prime if and only if it has exactly two (positive) divisors.",

		"The sum of an odd number > 1 (2i+1, i >= 1) of consecutive positive odd numbers centered on the j-th odd number >= 2i+1 (2j+1, j >= i) being (2i+1)*(2j+1) has 2 or more odd prime factors (odd semiprime iff 2i+1 and 2j+1 are primes). - Daniel Forgues, Jul 15 2009",
		"The paper by Kaoru Motose starts as follows: \"Let q be a prime divisor of a Mersenne number 2^p-1 where p is prime. Then p is the order of 2 (mod q). Thus p is a divisor of q - 1 and q > p. This shows that there exist infinitely many prime numbers.\" - Pieter Moree, Oct 14 2004",
		"1 is not a prime, for if the primes included 1, then the factorization of a natural number n into a product of primes would not be unique, since n = n*1.",
		"1 is the empty product (has 0 prime factors), whereas a prime has 1 prime factor (itself). - Daniel Forgues, Jul 23 2009",
		"Prime(n) and pi(n) are inverse functions: A000720(a(n)) = n and a(n) is the least number m such that a(A000720(m)) = a(n). a(A000720(n)) = n if (and only if) n is prime.",
		"Elementary primality test: If no prime <= sqrt(m) divides m, then m is prime (since a prime is its own exclusive multiple, apart from 1). - Lekraj Beedassy, Mar 31 2005",
		"Second sequence ever computed by electronic computer, on EDSAC, May 09 1949 (see Renwick link). - Russ Cox, Apr 20 2006",
		"Every prime p > 3 is a linear combination of previous primes prime(n) with nonzero coefficients c(n) and |c(n)| < prime(n). - Amarnath Murthy, Franklin T. Adams-Watters and Joshua Zucker, May 17 2006; clarified by Chayim Lowen, Jul 17 2015",
